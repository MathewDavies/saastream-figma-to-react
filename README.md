# Simple Web Page

This is a copy of the webpage from this figma file, made in React:

This was an exercise in Figma to React using tailwind. I also used Framer motion for a couple of animations and made the choices about responsiveness  myself. I have taken one or two liberties with the background colours and animated them, along with accordian animations.

There was no point in using Typescript as we didn't have any state in this application. If I were making this page in real life, I'd most likely use Next and statically generate it for the SEO and performance benefits.

Interestingly, Chat GPT 4.0 was able to write the SVG for the logo using text instructions.
