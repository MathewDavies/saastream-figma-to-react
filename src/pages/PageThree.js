    <p className='text-white text-sm mb-4'>I'm Matt, a React, Next JS and Firebase Developer. This is a demo page, showing my recreation of a Figma design using React and deploying on Firebase. I design and build projects, particularly creating MVPs for people who want to get an idea off the ground and see if they have product market fit. React is one of the most popular front end libraries and Next JS is a great framework built on React.</p>
    <p className='text-white text-sm mb-4'>Firebase is a Back End as a Service, from Google and offers one of the simplest, yet most comprehensive ways to create an application with features from databases to authoration to cloud storage to hosting. One massive selling point of Firebase is the low start cost and the ability to scale to hundreds of sometimes thousands of users before you start paying, then the ability to scale to millions of users effortlessly.</p>
